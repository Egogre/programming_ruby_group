### Chapter 1 Summary

Basically, Chapter 1 helps you get your system up and running, explains using `irb`, and explains how to run ruby programs. It also briefly overviews ri and RDoc, but I found that it would not return to me the documentation that I wanted to see in my terminal, so I gave up on that for now and am using' Pry's documentation from the terminal instead. Perhaps we can learn about how to use documentation in the terminal in class someday? (nudge nudge, instructors)

An added note to Persa's chapter 1 summary -- Footnote '10' might explain why the ri documentation doesn't work for us... It says that if you installed ruby with RVM, at the prompt you will have to enter '''rvm docs generate''' in order to make ri functional. I attempted this, but my internet connection wasn't strong enough to make it through downloading.

I've been advised to download the app Dash -- which is an instant offline search accross multiple languages (ruby included). The link is here: <https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dash-docs-snippets/id458034879?mt=12>
